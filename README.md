# IFT_diffusion_model
These are the files for my PhD project, developing the diffusion model of flagellar length control.

ift_diffusion_model_nlh.py is the agent-based simulation python program that uses object-oriented programming to simuluate the theory.

diffusion_model_tutorial.ipynb is the tutorial file on how to use ift_diffusion_model_nlh.py. The tutorial file is still under development.

ift_diffusion_model_two_flagella.py is the agent-based simulation that simulates two flagella that share from a common pool of material.

dissertation_v3_full is my dissertation. This explains the model and describes how I used it.

For more information, see my two papers:
1. Diffusion as a Ruler: Modeling Kinesin Diffusion as a Length Sensor for Intraflagellar Transport. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29414712/ This paper describes the diffusion model of ciliary length control and how the agent-based model proves its feasibility.
2. Speed and Diffusion of Kinesin-2 Are Competing Limiting Factors in Flagellar Length-Control Model. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32365327/ This paper uses differential equations to predict how parameter changes affect length, which can be used to explain length mutants.
