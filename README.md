# IFT_diffusion_model
These are the files for my PhD project, developing the diffusion model of flagellar length control.

ift_diffusion_model_nlh.py is the agent-based simulation python program that uses object-oriented programming to simuluate the theory.

diffusion_model_tutorial.ipynb is the tutorial file on how to use ift_diffusion_model_nlh.py. The tutorial file is still under development.

ift_diffusion_model_two_flagella.py is the agent-based simulation that simulates two flagella that share from a common pool of material.
